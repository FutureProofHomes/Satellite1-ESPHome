# By default, the Wi-Fi credentials provisioned on the Satellite1 device 
# during setup will be used. 
# 
# To override this and use the Wi-Fi credentials stored in the secrets.yaml 
# file of the ESPHome dashboard, uncomment the following lines. 
# This allows you to manage Wi-Fi credentials centrally for all your devices.

#wifi:
#  ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
#  password: !secret wifi_password
